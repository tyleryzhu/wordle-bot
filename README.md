# wordle-bot
Discord Bot for playing wordle and other word games.

I'm storing my bot token in an untracked file ```settings.py```, as well as a quick one-liner to get a list of words.


## Version History

* **v0.2**: Add a command to get a list of words and add multi-server support, and restarting games.
* **v0.1**: Initial release. Basic functionality with text commands.
